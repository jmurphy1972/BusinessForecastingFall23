### Load the Library and Read the Excel File (converted from .csv format)
### Create the time-series data frame by selecting the US_ALL_SECTORS column
```{r}
library(readxl)
Electricity_Data_US <- read_excel('electricity_data_US.xls', sheet='electricity_data_US')
Electricity_Data_US_ts <- ts(Electricity_Data_US$'US_ALL_SECTORS (thousand megawatts hours)', frequency = 12, start = c(2001,1), names = c("Date", "US_ALL_SECTORS"))
Electricity_Data_US_ts
```

### Load the Necesssary Libraries
```{r}
library(fpp)
library(fpp2)
library(TTR)
```


### Plot the Time-Series Data and Compute the Auto-Covariance Function
#### This is a plot of Electrical Energy Consumption in the U.S.
```{r}
attributes(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
plot(Electricity_Data_US_ts)

Acf(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
```


## Plot Mean Forecast Model
### The Mean Forecast, also known as the Simple Average Forecast, calculates the forecast by taking the simple average of past observations, giving each data point equal weight in the calculation. However, as shown in the plot, this model is not well-suited for forecasting based on the time-series data.
```{r}
#take Mean of all available history
mean_forecast <- meanf(Electricity_Data_US_ts,36)
plot(mean_forecast)
```


## Plot Naive Forecast Model
### The Naive Forecast uses the last observed value to produce a forecast.  This is known as a "no-change" forecast since it uses the last data point to forecast the data.  However, we can see that the confidence intervals are larger for the Naive forecast than for the Mean Forecast (both 80% and 95% confidence intervals).  The graph shows that this is not a good forecast model for the time-series data.
```{r}
# Naive
naive_forecast <- naive(Electricity_Data_US_ts,36)
plot(naive_forecast)
```


# Plot Random Walk Forecast Model
### The Random Walk Forecast bases its forecast on the last observed value in the data, which is similar to the Naive Forecast.  However, we can see that the confidence intervals are larger for the Random Walk forecast than they are for the Mean Forecast (both in the 80% and 95% confidence intervals).  The graph shows that this is not a good forecast model for the time-series data.
```{r}
# Random Walk
rwf_forecast <- rwf(Electricity_Data_US_ts,36, drift=FALSE)
plot(rwf_forecast)
```


# Plot Random Walk with Drift Forecast Model
## The Random Walk with Drift Forecast very closely resembles the Random Walk Forecast graph.  The Confidence Interval is the same as the Random Walk Forecast.  The graph shows that this is not a good forecast model for the time-series data.
```{r}
# Random Walk with Drift
rwf_forecast_drift <- rwf(Electricity_Data_US_ts,36, drift=TRUE)
plot(rwf_forecast_drift)
```


# Plot Seasonal Naive Forecast Model
### The Seasonal Naive Model produces a forecast that continues the same seasonal pattern of the actual data.  Because the time-series data has a highly seasonal pattern, the Seasonal Naive Forecast is a good forecast model to use.
```{r}
snaive_forecast <- snaive(Electricity_Data_US_ts,36)
plot(snaive_forecast)
```


# Plot Moving Average Forecast Models

## Moving Average with Order = 3
### The Moving Average (Order = 3) appears to be a good model for the data.  The data is seasonal and this plot shows the seasonal nature of the time-series data.  Since there are sudden shifts in the data, the smaller order of the Moving Average Forecast is a better fit for the data than larger orders.  A smaller order is a better fit when there are sudden shifts in the data.
```{r}
MA3_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=3)
plot(MA3_forecast)
```

## Moving Average with Order = 6
### The Moving Average (Order = 6) smooths out the data more than the Moving Average plot for Order=3.  The plot still shows the seasonal nature of the data, even though the graph is slightly smoother.  The larger the order for the Moving Average Forecast, the greater the smoothing effect that will be shown in the graph.  We can observe that the spikes in data are not as sharp in this forecast.
```{r}
MA6_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=6)
plot(MA6_forecast)
```

## Moving Average with Order = 12
### The Moving Average (Order = 12) demonstrates a higher level of data smoothing compared to the preceding plot. It's worth noting that the greater the order of the Moving Average, the more pronounced the smoothing effect becomes in the graph. This increased smoothing makes it less apparent to discern the regular seasonal patterns within the time-series data.  We can observe that the spikes in data are even less discernible and sharp in this forecast.
```{r}
MA12_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=12)
plot(MA12_forecast)
```

## Moving Average with Order = 18
### The Moving Average (Order = 18) appears to show more of the seasonal nature of the data better than the Moving Average (Order = 12).  Even though this graph shows more of a seasonal than the previous graph, the error is larger with this higher order of 18.  It will be shown in the Accuracy section that this graph produces more absolute error than the previous graph.
```{r}
MA18_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=18)
plot(MA18_forecast)
```

## Moving Average with Order = 36
### The Moving Average (Order = 36) shows more of a smoothing than the previous Moving Average graphs  This graph demonstrates that the larger the order of the Moving Average, the greater the smoothing effect.  The large spikes in data are no longer visible with this amount of smoothing.
```{r}
MA36_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=36)
plot(MA36_forecast)
```

## Moving Average with Order = 72
### The Moving Average (72) shows the most smoothing out of all the Moving Average plots.  This plot demonstrates the principle that the larger the order of the Moving Average, the greater the smoothing effect of the graph.
```{r}
MA72_forecast <- ma(Electricity_Data_US_ts,order=72)
plot(MA72_forecast)
```


# Plot Holt-Winters Forecast Models
### Holt-Winters Forecast #1 - With No Filters
```{r}
HW_forecast <- HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
attributes(HW_forecast)
summary(HW_forecast)
```

### Holt-Winters Forecast #1 Summary
#### The Holt-Winters plot shows a good fit with the actual data in terms of the trend and the seasonality.  This shows that the Holt-Winters plot is a good forecast model for this time-series data.  Based on the comparison between the actual and forecast data (red and black lines), the error is minimal for this forecast model.

#### The Holt-Winters plot shows there is far more seasonality (gamma) than trend (beta) in the time-series data.
####  alpha: 0.3902766
####  beta : 0.01085984
####  gamma: 0.331543

```{r}
plot(HW_forecast)
```


### Holt-Winters Forecast #2 - Filters: (Beta = TRUE and Gamma = TRUE)
#### This filter has no exponential smoothing and a seasonal model is fitted to the data.
```{r}
SSE_Simple <- HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=TRUE, gamma=TRUE)
HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=TRUE, gamma=TRUE)
attributes(SSE_Simple)
SSE_Simple$SSE
```

### Holt-Winters Forecast #2 Summary
#### The Holt-Winters plot shows a good fit with the actual data in terms of the seasonality.  However, this forecast model shows more errors between the actual and forecast data (red and black lines) than the previous Holt-Winters plot without the filters.  The previous Holt-Winters plot was a better fit of the data.
```{r}
plot(SSE_Simple)
```


### Holt-Winters Forecast #3 - Filters: (Beta = FALSE and Gamma = TRUE)
#### This filter has exponential smoothing and a seasonal model is fitted to the data.
```{r}
SSE_Simple_2 <- HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=FALSE, gamma=TRUE)
HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=FALSE, gamma=TRUE)
attributes(SSE_Simple_2)
SSE_Simple_2$SSE
```

### Holt-Winters Forecast #3 Summary
#### The Holt-Winters graph shows a better fit with the actual data than the previous model.  When exponential smoothing is applied, and a seasonal model is used, then the forecast model provides a better fit.  However, the Holt-Winters graph without filters still shows a better fit than any of the other Holt-Winters models.
```{r}
plot(SSE_Simple_2)
```


### Holt-Winters Forecast #4 - Filters: (Beta = TRUE and Gamma = FALSE)
#### This filter has no exponential smoothing and a non-seasonal model is fitted to the data.
```{r}
SSE_Simple_3 <- HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=TRUE, gamma=FALSE)
HoltWinters(Electricity_Data_US_ts, beta=TRUE, gamma=FALSE)
attributes(SSE_Simple_3)
SSE_Simple_3$SSE
```

### Holt-Winters Forecast #4 Summary
#### The Holt-Winters graph shows a worse fit with the actual data than any of the previous Holt-Winters Forecast Models. The main difference is that this Holt-Winters filter assumes a non-seasonal fit of the data  Since this time-series data shows a highly seasonal pattern, it is no surprise that there are significant differences between the actual data and the forecast data (black and red lines) with this forecast model.
```{r}
plot(SSE_Simple_3)
```


# Plot the Time-Series and Different Model Forecasts in One Chart

#### The Moving Average Forecasts are shown in the graph with the time-series data.  Generally, the larger the order of the Moving Average, the greater the smoothing effect.  The Moving Averages with a smaller order show a greater amplitude and a better fit of the data than the Moving Averages with a larger order.
#### The Mean Forecast shows a forecast  that is calculated from the mean of all the data points.  All the data points are given an equal weight when calculating the Mean Forecast.
#### The Naive and Random Walk Forecasts are calculated from the value of the last observed data point.
#### The Seasonal Naive Forecast appears to continue the same seasonal pattern into the future.

# Pick an Accuracy Measure, Compare Your Models, and State the Best Model Based on the Accuracy Comparison

## Summary

#### The MAPE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) is selected as the accuracy measure to compare the different forecast models.  

#### The best forecast model to use for this time-series data is the Holt-Winters Forecast (with no filters).  It has a MAPE value of 2.331722 which is the lowest out of all the forecast models.

#### It should be noted that the Holt-Winters Forecast (with no filters) has the lowest MAPE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values when compared with the other forecast models.  Given the seasonal nature of the time-series data, it is not surprising that Holt-Winters is the best model to use in this accuracy comparison.

#### The second-best model is the Holt-Winters Forecast with Filters (beta=FALSE, gamma=TRUE).  It also has the second-lowest MAPE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values when compared with the other forecast models.

#### The third-best model is the Seasonal Naive Forecast.  It has the third-lowest MAPE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values when compared with the other forecast models.
