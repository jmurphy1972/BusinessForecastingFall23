## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Load the Library and Read the Excel File (converted from .csv format)
### Create the time-series data frame by selecting the US_ALL_SECTORS column
```{r}
library(readxl)
Electricity_Data_US <- read_excel('electricity_data_US.xls', sheet='electricity_data_US')
Electricity_Data_US_ts <- ts(Electricity_Data_US$'US_ALL_SECTORS (thousand megawatts hours)', frequency = 12, start = c(2001,1), names = c("Date", "US_ALL_SECTORS"))
Electricity_Data_US_ts
```

### Load the Necessary Libraries
```{r}
library(fpp)
library(fpp2)
library(TTR)
```

## Plot the Time-Series Data
```{r}
head(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
plot(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
```

### Plot the Acf of the Time-Series Data
##### The Time-Series Data has significant values and shows Seasonality at Lag=12 and Lag=24
```{r}
Acf(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
```

## Compute Seasonal Decomposition of Time-Series by Loess
```{r}
stl_decomp <- stl(Electricity_Data_US_ts, s.window = "periodic")

attributes(stl_decomp)
stl_decomp$call
stl_decomp$win
stl_decomp$inner
stl_decomp$outer
```

### Plot the Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess Graph
```{r}
plot(stl_decomp)
```

## Compute Seasonal Adjustment of Seasonal Decomposition of Time-Series by Loess
### Plot the Seasonal Adjustment of Seasonal Decomposition Graph
```{r}
tmp <- seasadj(stl_decomp)
plot(tmp)
```

### Plot the Graph and Include Original Time-Series Data on Plot
```{r}
plot(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
lines(tmp, col = "Purple")
```

## Plot the Forecast of Seasonal Decomposition by Loess
```{r}
f_stl <- forecast(stl_decomp, h=12)
plot(f_stl)
lines(f_stl$fitted, col="Red")
```

### Accuracy of Forecast of Seasonal Decomposition of Time-Series by Loess
```{r}
accuracy(f_stl)
```

### Plot the Acf of the Forecast of Decomposition
#### The Acf is mostly insignificant except for Lag = 24
```{r}
Acf(f_stl$residuals)
```

## Plot the Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages of Electricity Data
```{r}
decomp_elec <- decompose(Electricity_Data_US_ts)
plot(decomp_elec)
attributes(decomp_elec)
```

## Plot the Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages  of Electricity Data by Multiplicative Seasonal Component
#### The scales of seasonal and random have changed under the Multiplicative seasonal component.
```{r}
decomp_elec <- decompose(Electricity_Data_US_ts, type="multiplicative")
plot(decomp_elec)
attributes(decomp_elec)
```

### Plot the Forecast of Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages 
```{r}
#f_decomp_elec <- forecast(decomp_elec, h=12)
#plot(f_decomp_elec)
#accuracy(f_decomp_elec)
```

## Plot the Forecast of Seasonal Adjustment of Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages 
```{r}
f_seas <- forecast(seasadj(decomp_elec), h=12)
plot(f_seas)
```

### Accuracy of Forecast of Seasonal Adjustment of Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages
#### The Accuracy of this Forecast is better than Accuracy of Seasonal Adjustment of Seasonal Decomposition 
#### of Time Series by Loess on Measures of RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE, and MASE
```{r}
accuracy(f_seas)
```

### Plot the Acf of the Forecast of Classical Decomposition by Moving Averages
#### The Acf is mostly insignificant except for Lag = 24
```{r}
Acf(f_seas$residuals)
```
